Hunger is a small term to use and think about, but surprisingly, it is the emotions that is naturally bounded to the body.
Do you ever think how it is likely to be starving for hours and hours and may be days.
Well definitely every individual in this world has atleast went through hunger once.
Therefore,the struggle and belief of people lead them to later completely break down physically and emotionally.
People generally waste a lot of food,clothes and many other things but they do not realize how actually is helpful to
homeless and poor or needy people in New York. About 40% food is wasted in the state as recorded. 
Over 1.4 million New Yorkers lacked sufficient food in 2012-2014.
The scarcity of food is mostly in Bronx in New York city bu there are more areas in New York 
where people live on streets and get less food which lead them to beg.
 In both the state and city, the minimum wage is now $8.75 per hour, 
 equaling $15,925 for a year of full-time work, leaving a worker with even one child 
 below the federal poverty line. Taxes also remain a deal for people which takes half of their income.
 The main causes are the rent,house and different prices of other uses that take higher expenses especially  in New York city
 In a city of 8.5 million people, more than 58,000 homeless men, women and children sleep in homeless shelters and 
 at least 3,100 more sleep on the streets and subways in the winter with shortage of food. 
 This means that one in every 147 New Yorkers is currently homeless. In New York City alone in 2012-2014,
 more than 450,000 residents lived in food insecure households that included at least one person working.
 For this we need huge donation of food or fund to assist the people in need. Even a dollar from a person can help incredibly if assembled.
 Moreover, your assertive personality and the simple effort can feed thousands of people in the state.
